## What is [Beckn Protocol](https://becknprotocol.io/)?

The [Beckn Protocol](https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications) represents an exceptional open protocol that seamlessly enables the facilitation of discovery and transactions between businesses and applications. This is achieved through the implementation of a decentralized architecture, asynchronous server-to-server communication, and a robust core specification for e-commerce events.

## What is the DENT Protocol?

[DENT Protocol](https://github.com/beckn/DENT-Protocol) is derived from the Beckn protocol, the Decentralized Energy Transaction (DENT) Protocol enables interoperable and decentralized commercial transactions in the  energy sector. It establishes a network of platforms that facilitate the exchange of energy contracts between various entities, thereby enabling the transfer of energy from producers to consumers.


## What is the project mission?

- The Decentralized Energy Transaction (DENT) Protocol aims to revolutionize energy exchanges by making them secure and seamless. DENT Protocol, an extension of Beckn, addresses energy industry issues.
- Decentralized energy transactions enable more efficient and eco-friendly energy consumption with DENT Protocol. Interoperability between energy providers and consumers improves EV charging, battery swapping, and microgrid energy distribution. 
- The DENT Protocol speeds EV and renewable energy adoption by streamlining energy flows. It's crucial to a sustainable energy future, improving energy service resilience and accessibility while reducing environmental impact.
- In conclusion, DENT Protocol aims to improve energy transactions' efficiency, security, and sustainability. It's a foundation for energy innovation and sustainability.
